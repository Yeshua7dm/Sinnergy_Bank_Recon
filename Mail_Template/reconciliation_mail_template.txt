Hi,
The Robot has successfully completed the Bank Reconciliation process.
At the start of the process, the robot found var_start_items items to be reconciled.
After completing the reconciliation the already matched items, var_after_ok items were still undone.
After the trying to find and match transactions, there are var_after_match items left undone. These remaining transactions need to be handled manually by the officer-in-charge.

Regards,
Sinnergy RPA Robot
