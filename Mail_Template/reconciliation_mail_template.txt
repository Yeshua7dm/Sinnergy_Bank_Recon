Hi,

The Robot has successfully completed the Bank Reconciliation process.
At the start of the process, the robot found VarStartItems items to be reconciled.
After completing the reconciliation the already matched items, VarAfterOk items were still undone.

After the trying to find and match transactions, there are VarAfterMatch items left undone.
These remaining transactions need to be handled manually by the officer-in-charge.


Regards,
